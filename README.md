# Matrix_Factorization_for_Recommender_System
 
In this project, I built a recommendation system to make predictions related to reviews of Electronics products on Amazon. I used the User-Item utility matrix and built an alternating least square (ALS) based recommendation systems. Refer to the problem statement and the notes on Matrix Factorization for a detailed discussion of the problem and the algorithm. The dataset can be found at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/cse255/data/assignment2.tar.gz.
